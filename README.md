Hello, I'm Jay. Im interested in food, beer, football, anything IT and tropical environments. 
Normally you will find me behind these 3 screens doing something other than what I should be doing.
Currently Working on a degree in IT and building a business and a brand.
Trying figure out how to put this 3D Printer together that arrived at my door step in thousand pieces. It may take awhile.
